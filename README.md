# ROS-Differential-Drive-Robot
This is my first project after learning ROS for the first time. I am using a 3D printed chassis to make a differential drive robot. The robot has 4 wheels that can move either forward or backward only. The front and back wheels of a side (Left & Right) are controlled simulatenously from the motor driver. I am using L298N DC motor driver for controlling these motors.


this repository contains source code for simple differential drive control with ROS. There are 2 basic control scheme that are included. First, a keyboard controller to move the robot. Second, use a web camera to get images and approach the desired object (colored object).
